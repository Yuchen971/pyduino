# this script reads off from arduino on the go.
# it is currently confirmed that arduino behaves similarly as all the scale sensors
# 1. having internal buffers
# 2. Being able to use simple serial interface to communicate with
# currently it is decided to use the time in raspberry pi/PC to record the time that
#    data collected by arduino for two reasons:
# 1. it is not known how much arduino time will be derivated over time.
# 2. raspberry pi has internet connected and so has time well syncronized. 
#
# However, it is always important that the reading intervals in arduino has to be 
#    the same as the current script reading interval. because the existing buffer in 
#    arduino may cause the time deviation between the time arduino has been read and 
#    the time raspberry has recorded the data
# Also, user needs to close the monitoring interfce in arduino GUID, as each USB port
#    can only be occupied by one process. 
# It is found so far that arduino will store 500 undisplayed data, if these data has
#    yet retrived, arduino will stop running as indicated by RX stopped flashing.
# basic usage:
#    moving the working directory to the folder where the python file exists:
# In [1]: cd /home/chenming/pydrino/python
#    execute the file
# In [2]: execfile('read_arduino.py')
# In [3]: pwd
#    pwd shows the current directory

# the time interval between each reading from arduino in seconds
# be careful about the data collection interval in arduino, it is always good 
# to make the sleep_time_seconds to be the same as the time interval in arduino
# to minimize the data loss.
# e.g., if arduino time interval is 1, python interval is 10, arduino will produce
# more data than python can actually retrive, as a result, arduino may replace the 
# existing data, cause the inconsistency between the data collection in arduino and 
# data save in python
# similar situation applies for commercial scales.
